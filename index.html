				<h3>Athletic Shorts</h3>
				<p>
				I'm always rotating between the same 2 pairs. I like pockets and roughly 
				6-inch inseams. I usually fit best in a medium.

				<h3>Shirts</h3>
				<p>
				I tend to rotate between a couple favorites.
				My favorites are breathable and soft, and darker colors such as navy, 
				dark green, and gray.
				I wear a medium.

				<h3>Pants</h3>
				<p>
				I have some pants I really like, but they're incorrectly sized.
				The ones I have and like are LuluLemon's ABCs (what kind of name
				is that for pants?). I wear a 31 waist 30 length.

				<h3>Boxers/Boxer Briefs</h3>
				<p>
				I wear a medium, but occasionally wish for a large in certain brands.

				<h3>Target Gift Cards</h3>

				some small pieces of furniture.

				<h3>Mugs</h3>
				<p>
				I drink a lot of tea nowadays, and I always like using my mugs
				that commemorate a special place or event.

				<h3>Crampons</h3>
				<p>
				I'm not sure how they work, or even if they use size ranges, 
				but I'm aiming to do some winter hiking in Colorado and need some 
				extra traction.
